# The Web side of an Adobe XD Plugin for Exporting global colors and caracter styles to Tailwind

This website converts the data transmitted by an Adobe XD plugin into tailwind classes. 
This website also gives you the possibility to reorder the classes via an interface.

The Plugin exprts your global Colors and Caracter styles to an self-written converter (this one) which converts the data to tailwind classes.
